        TERI has been working on the projects that emphasize on ensuring nutritional security, directly or indirectly through multi-pronged <br>approaches that are designed to ensure the long term sustainability of the interventions undertaken as part of the projects. The main themes focused upon in the projects include bio-prospecting of <br>natural resources, building sustainable communities and related projects that overlap and have linkages to ensure nutrition security and long term sustainability.<br> The initiatives undertaken have been planned in such a way that the diverse stakeholders from both rural and urban areas would be made aware about the current status of this important issue and encouraged to tackle malnourishment<br> using simple methods and resources easily available in the local area. This would not only ensure sustainability of the interventions but also magnify their benefits.<br><br></div>

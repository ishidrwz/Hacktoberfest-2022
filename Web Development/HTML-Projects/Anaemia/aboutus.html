Protein is found in a wide range of food and it’s important that you get enough protein in your diet every day. How much protein you need from your diet varies depending on your weight, gender, age and health.  Meeting your protein needs is easily achieved from eating a variety of foods. Protein from food comes from plant and animal sources such as meat and fish, eggs, dairy products, seeds and nuts, and legumes like beans and lentils.<br></div>

        <br>Some food sources of dietary protein include:lean meats – beef, lamb, veal, pork, kangaroopoultry – chicken, turkey, duck, emu, goose, bush birds<br>
        fish and seafood – fish, prawns, crab, lobster, mussels, oysters, scallops, clams
        eggsdairy products – milk, yoghurt (especially Greek yoghurt), cheese (especially cottage cheese)
        nuts (including nut pastes) <br>and seeds – almonds, pine nuts, walnuts, macadamias, hazelnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower<br> seedslegumes and beans – all beans, lentils, chickpeas, split peas, tofu.Some grain and cereal-based products are also sources of protein, but are generally not as high in protein as meat and meat-alternative products. If you’re looking for ways to get more protein into your diet, here are some suggestions:<br><br><br>
        Try a peanut butter sandwich. Remember to use natural peanut butter (or any other nut paste) with no added salt, sugar or other fillers.Low-fat cottage or ricotta cheese is<br> high in protein and can go in your scrambled eggs, casserole, mashed potato or pasta dish. Or spread it on your toast in the morning.
        Nuts and seeds are fantastic in salads, with vegetables and served on top of curries. Try toasting some pine nuts or flaked almonds and putting them in your green salad. <br>
        Beans are great in soups, casseroles, and pasta sauces. Try tipping a drained can of cannellini beans into your favourite vegetable soup recipe or casserole.<br>
        A plate of hummus and freshly cut vegetable sticks as a snack or hummus spread on your sandwich will give you easy extra protein at lunchtime. 
        Greek yoghurt is a protein rich food that you can use throughout the day. Add some on your favourite breakfast cereal, put a spoonful on top of a bowl<br> of pumpkin soup or serve it as dessert with some fresh fruit. Eggs are a versatile and easy option that can be enjoyed on their own or mixed in a variety of dishes. <br>
